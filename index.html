            <h2>Seattle's Trees Are At Risk</h2>
             <p>
                Trees provide a wide range of environmental, social, and economic benefits, which can be compromised by
                urbanization. To mitigate the negative effects of urban development on trees, it is important to
                implement policies and practices that prioritize tree preservation, planting, and maintenance. </p>
             
           
                <p>A
                collaborative effort between urban planners, developers, and arborists can help to create more livable
                and sustainable cities where trees thrive alongside urban development. By recognizing the value of trees
                in our urban landscapes, we can create a healthier and more resilient future for our communities.
